        <h1>This is <em>still</em> a simplistic website.</h1>
        <p>And it's more perfect than the last guy's.</p>
    </header>

<!-- Premier paragraphe -->
    <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal effort to improve this site.</h2>
    <h3>7 declarations.</h3>
    <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="https://mithendril.github.io/simplisticwebsite/">grotesque thing</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect website:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li> <em>Still</em> fits on all your screens</li>
        <li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your browsers</li>
        <li>The simplistic's <em>still</em> accessible to every people that visits your site</li>
        <li>It's <em>still</em> legible and gets your point across</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>And guess what:</h3>
    <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>

<!-- Second paragraphe -->
    <h2>Let it breathe</h2>
    <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some website you're building. The defaults are ugly -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...</p>
    <p>If your text hits the side of the browser, you loose. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a weird book.</p>

<!-- Troisième paragraphe -->
    <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
    <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 lines.</p>

<!-- Quatrième paragraphe -->
    <h2>Size Matters</h2>
    <p>Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>

<!-- Cinquième paragarphe -->
    <h2>Line-width</h2>
    <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
    <h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> satire</h3>
    <p>I love what the creator of <a href="https://mithendril.github.io/simplisticwebsite/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not totaly bad.</p>
